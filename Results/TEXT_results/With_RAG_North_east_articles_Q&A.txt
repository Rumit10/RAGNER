Question: what is eka sharana Nama?
Answer: Eka Sharana Nama is a cultural and religious tradition of North East India, particularly in Assam. The term "Eka" means "one," and "Sharana" refers to the Sharanagati tradition, which emphasizes devotion and surrender to God. "Nâma" means "name" or "culture." Therefore, Eka Sharana Nama can be interpreted as a single or unified culture that encompasses various aspects of North East Indian traditions, including music, dance, art, and religion.

The Eka Sharana Nama tradition was codified and systematized by Srimanta Sankaradeva, a 15th-century Assamese philosopher, poet, and social reformer. He integrated various local traditions and beliefs into this culture, including elements from the tribal cultures of North East India. As a result, Eka Sharana Nama reflects a rich tapestry of cultural influences, which have been preserved and passed down through generations.

Some of the key features of Eka Sharana Nama include:

1. Kirtanghar or Nâmghar: This is the most important element among these, which is a multi-dimensional institution that encompasses various aspects of North East Indian culture, including music, dance, art, and religion.
2. Murang-ghar or Dekâ-châng: This is another tribal institution that has influenced the Eka Sharana Nama tradition.
3. Nâgârâ: A contribution of the Tiwa tribe of Assam, this instrument is closely similar to Ludâng-khrâm and is used in various cultural practices.
4. Bhor-tal: An indispensable instrument in the Nâm-Prasanga or Kirtana, etc., which came from Bhutan.
5. Sarengdâr: Another instrument that came from the tribal tradition of North East India.
