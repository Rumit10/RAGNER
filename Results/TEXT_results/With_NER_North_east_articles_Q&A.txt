Question: what is eka sharana Nama?
Answer: Eka Sharana Nama is a term used in the context of Assamese culture and religion. It refers to the shared beliefs, practices, and rituals of the different tribes and castes of North East India, particularly those living in Assam. The term "Eka" means "one," and "Sharana" means "body." Therefore, Eka Sharana Nama can be translated as "the one body of Assamese culture and religion."

The concept of Eka Sharana Nama was introduced by the 15th-century Assamese saint and social reformer Srimanta Sankaradeva. He believed that all the tribes and castes of North East India were part of a larger cultural and religious entity, and that they shared a common identity and heritage. Through his efforts, he was able to create a unified cultural identity for the people of Assam, which transcended caste and tribe differences.

It emphasizes the importance of mutual respect, understanding, and harmony among all segments of society, and promotes a sense of shared identity and belonging among the people of North East India.
